   - Focus on: search methods, playlist operations, favorites management

2. **server.py** (239 lines, 14.59% coverage):
   - MCP server endpoint testing could contribute ~5-8% overall coverage
   - Focus on: tool registration, request handling, response formatting

3. **utils.py** (126 lines, 9.28% coverage):
   - Utility function testing could contribute ~3-5% overall coverage
   - Focus on: validation functions, data conversion utilities

### Estimated Coverage Potential:
- **service.py** improvements: +15-20% overall
- **server.py** improvements: +5-8% overall
- **utils.py** improvements: +3-5% overall
- **Total potential:** 58-68% overall coverage

## Test Suite Health Analysis

### Strengths:
- Comprehensive fixture system in place
- Good async test support
- Proper mocking and isolation
- 70.5% test pass rate shows solid foundation

### Areas for Improvement:
- 157 failing tests indicate integration issues
- Some mocks may need better configuration
- Test data setup could be more robust

## Recommendations for Reaching 60% Coverage

### Phase 1 Completion Strategy:

1. **Immediate Actions (Target: +20% coverage):**
   - Add basic service method tests for search, playlist, favorites
   - Add server endpoint tests for core MCP tools
   - Add utility function tests for validation and conversion

2. **Quick Implementation Focus:**
   - Unit tests for public service methods (vs integration tests)
   - Simple success/failure test cases
   - Mock-heavy tests to avoid external dependencies

3. **Coverage Verification:**
   - Run coverage after each module improvement
   - Target 50-60% on service.py to achieve overall 60%
   - Maintain existing high coverage modules
