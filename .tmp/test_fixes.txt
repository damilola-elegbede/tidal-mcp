Key test patterns that need fixing:

1. Conversion methods tests - these should test the real conversion logic using tidal_service fixture
2. Utility method tests - need proper return value configuration
3. Remaining playlist operation tests - simplify to just test mock returns
4. Favorites, radio, detail retrieval tests - simplify to test mock returns
5. Error handling tests - configure proper side effects

The main issue is tests are mixing real service testing with mock service testing.
Tests using mock_service should only test the interface, not the implementation.
Tests using tidal_service should test real logic with mocked external dependencies.
