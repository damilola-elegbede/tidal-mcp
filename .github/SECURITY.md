## Security Best Practices

### For Users

1. **Keep Updated**: Always use the latest version of Tidal MCP
2. **Secure Configuration**:
   - Use environment variables for sensitive configuration
   - Never commit credentials to version control
   - Use strong, unique API keys
3. **Network Security**:
   - Use HTTPS for all API communications
   - Implement proper firewall rules
   - Consider using VPN for sensitive environments

### For Developers

1. **Code Security**:
   - Follow OWASP security guidelines
   - Use parameterized queries for database operations
   - Validate all inputs
   - Sanitize outputs

2. **Dependency Management**:
   - Regularly update dependencies
   - Use dependency scanning tools
   - Pin dependency versions in production

3. **Authentication & Authorization**:
   - Implement proper authentication
   - Use principle of least privilege
   - Validate permissions for all operations

## Security Features

### Built-in Security

- **Input Validation**: All inputs are validated and sanitized
- **Secure Communication**: All API communications use HTTPS
- **Authentication**: Proper OAuth2 implementation for Tidal API
- **Error Handling**: Secure error messages that don't leak sensitive information

### Security Scanning

Our CI/CD pipeline includes:

- **Static Analysis**: Bandit for Python security issues
- **Dependency Scanning**: Safety for known vulnerabilities
- **Code Quality**: SonarQube for security code smells
- **Container Scanning**: For Docker images (if applicable)

## Known Security Considerations

### API Keys and Secrets

- Tidal API credentials must be kept secure
- Use environment variables or secure secret management
- Rotate credentials regularly
- Monitor for exposed credentials in logs

### Rate Limiting

- Implement client-side rate limiting
- Respect Tidal API rate limits
- Handle rate limit errors gracefully

### Data Privacy

- Minimize data collection and storage
- Implement data retention policies
- Follow GDPR and other privacy regulations
- Encrypt sensitive data in transit and at rest
